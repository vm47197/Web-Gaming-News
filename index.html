                    <p>"Beginning December 15th, we’re launching a new performance mode on all PCs that meet Fortnite’s
                        minimum specifications. Available in Alpha, Performance Mode will be selectable through the
                        in-game settings menu and offers significant performance gains by trading out visual quality to
                        lower memory usage and lighten the load on CPU and GPU. For players already on low scalability
                        settings or less powerful hardware, this mode will allow the game to run better than ever before
                        and maintain a smoother framerate" Says the Fortnite Team.</p>

                    <p>Snapchat is getting a new original game called Bitmoji Paint. As the name suggests, the game
                        involves Bitmoji — those cutely grotesque customizable avatars — and painting. It’s Snap Inc.’s
                        fourth title from its internal games studio, which began putting out games last year. “Our goal
                        with Bitmoji has always been to be the world’s avatar, to give people a digital version of
                        themselves that represents them and lets them be themselves online,” says Ba Blackstock,
                        co-founder of Bitmoji. “And so now with games, it’s also letting people play together in a
                        really new and fun and exciting way.”</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Electronic Arts has agreed to buy out UK developer Codemasters in a move that could see the US
                        publishing giant wrest control of the racing video game genre. The deal is expected to close in
                        the first quarter of next year for £6.04 (~$7.98) a share, valuing Codemasters at around $1.2
                        billion.

                        Sky News first reported EA’s interest in Codemasters over the weekend, saying that the British
                        company had previously agreed a $970 million deal with Rockstar Games and 2K Sports owner
                        Take-Two Interactive. EA confirmed the agreement early Monday morning.</p>

                        Forward digital conference today. The cinematic trailer didn’t have any gameplay, but showed a
                        city in revolt under the regime of Antón Castillo, who is played by Giancarlo Esposito, perhaps
                        best known as Gus Fring in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.
                        In Far Cry 6, players control Dani Rojas, who is tasked with stopping Castillo’s regime. Much
                        like its predecessors Far Cry 5 and Far Cry New Dawn, the playable character will be
                        customizable and can be played as either a male or female. But Far Cry 6 will also see the
                        return of a voiced protagonist, GameSpot reports.</p>

                            Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the twelfth major installment and the twenty-second
                            release in the Assassin's Creed series, and a successor to the 2018's Assassin's Creed
                            Odyssey. Set in 873 AD, the game recounts a fictional story during the Viking invasion of
                            Britain. The player controls Eivor, a Viking raider who becomes embroiled in the conflict
                            between the Brotherhood of Assassins and the Templar Order.[c]

                            The game was released on November 10, 2020, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One,
                            Xbox Series X and Series S, and Stadia, while the PlayStation 5 version was released on
                            November 12. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the
                            graphics and story, but criticized it for technical issues and lack of innovation.</span>

                        <span>Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed and published by CD
                            Projekt. The story takes place in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe.
                            Players assume the first-person perspective of a customisable mercenary known as V, who can
                            acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and ranged combat.
                            The game was developed using the REDengine 4 by a team of around 500 people, exceeding the
                            number that worked on the studio's previous game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015). CD Projekt
                            launched a new division in Wrocław, Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC,
                            and Jali Research to aid the production. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant,
                            and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role. The original score was led by Marcin
                            Przybyłowicz, featuring the contributions of several licensed artists.
                            CD Projekt released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on 10
                            December 2020, with PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions planned to follow in 2021. It
                            received praise for its narrative, setting, and graphics, although some of its gameplay
                            elements received mixed responses. In contrast, it was widely criticized for bugs,
                            particularly in the console versions which also suffered from performance issues; Sony
                            removed it from the PlayStation Store on 17 December 2020.</span>

                            tweeted on Thursday.

                            “My recent job at Riot has been to help develop the League universe, which we’re going to
                            need!” Street said. “My new job is to kick off a big (some might say massive) game that many
                            of you, and many Rioters, have been asking us to create.” If the deliberate use of the word
                            “massive” in that quote wasn’t enough of a hint, in a reply to another Twitter user, Street
                            confirmed the game is an MMO.The new MMO isn’t entirely surprising, as Riot has been working
                            to expand the League universe into other games and mediums as of late</span>

                            Among Us is an online social deduction game, one in which players have to work together to
                            complete tasks around the ship and figure out who the crew’s imposters are. Imposters,

                            first launched in 2018, it’s become a sensation, thanks to a newfound popularity on Twitch,
                            played by streamers and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Among Us has become so popular, in
                            fact, that Innersloth canceled the game’s sequel to focus on improving the original.
                            The game picked up the award for best multiplayer title of the year during this year’s Game
                            Awards. A new airship map is expected next year.

                        <span>Beginning December 15th, the Fortnite team is launching a new performance mode on all PCs
                            that meet
                            Fortnite’s minimum specifications. Available in Alpha, Performance Mode will be selectable
                            through the in-game settings menu and offers significant performance gains by trading out
                            visual quality to lower memory usage and lighten the load on CPU and GPU. For players
                            already on low scalability settings or less powerful hardware, this mode will allow the game
                            to run better than ever before and maintain a smoother framerate.Performance Mode is opt-in
                            for most users and will launch with support for Battle Royale and Creative mode only. Users
                            running on older hardware will see a prompt pushing them to the mode to try it out as the
                            recommended way to experience the game. Performance Mode can be enabled or disabled at any
                            time through the in-game settings menu and restarting the game.</span>

                            players can come together simultaneously to contribute to one, massive collage.
                            Built by Snap Games Studio, Bitmoji Paint introduces a whole new kind of game inside of
                            Snapchat. Snapchatters’ Bitmojis can travel the globe, team up with friends and let their
                            imagination run free on one shared canvas. Simple scribbles, fun messages or even giant
                            landscapes are all possible in Bitmoji Paint.We are also introducing Snap Tokens to
                            customize the Bitmoji Paint experience for Android users. Snap Tokens are digital goods that
                            can be purchased and stored in a virtual wallet tied to your Snapchat account. Within
                            Bitmoji Paint on Android, Snap Tokens can be used toward roller skates or hoverboards to
                            move around the game more quickly, or things like an ink painter or a paint roller to make
                            larger creations." Say the Snapchat Bitmoji Paint Team.</span>

                        <span>Electronic Arts has agreed to buy out UK developer Codemasters in a move that could see
                            the US publishing giant wrest control of the racing video game genre. The deal is expected
                            to close in the first quarter of next year for £6.04 (~$7.98) a share, valuing Codemasters
                            at around $1.2 billion.

                            Sky News first reported EA’s interest in Codemasters over the weekend, saying that the
                            British company had previously agreed a $970 million deal with Rockstar Games and 2K Sports
                            owner Take-Two Interactive. EA confirmed the agreement early Monday morning.

                            Codemasters is one of the oldest British game developers, having been founded in the ‘80s
                            and producing early hits like Dizzy for systems that were popular in the UK like the ZX
                            Spectrum and the Commodore 64. In recent decades it’s been best known for creating racing
                            games like the Dirt, Grid, and Formula 1 series, and last year acquired the developer behind
                            Project Cars.</span>

                        <span>Far Cry 6 is an upcoming first-person shooter game developed by Ubisoft Toronto and
                            published by Ubisoft. It is the sixth main installment of the Far Cry series for Amazon
                            Luna, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and
                            Stadia.

                            The game is set on Yara, a fictional Caribbean island ruled as a dictatorship by "El
                            Presidente" Antón Castillo (portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito), who is raising his son Diego
                            (Anthony Gonzalez) to follow in his rule. The player takes the role of guerilla fighter Dani
                            Rojas, attempting to topple Castillo and his regime.Production of Far Cry 6 had been ongoing
                            for four years at the time of its July 2020 announcement, with Ubisoft Toronto the lead
                            studio for the game.[5] Narrative director Navid Khavari said that they started researching
                            on revolutions of the past, they came across the idea of the modern guerrilla revolution
                            such as the Cuban Revolution, which gave them numerous ideas of how to drive the
                            player-character into fighting against a repressive government. </span>
